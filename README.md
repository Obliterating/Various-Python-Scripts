# Various-Python-Scripts
I began learning to code when I was in elementary school, I think in the 2nd grade. I believe I learned javascript first, but later moved on to Python with codecademy. I've used Python whenever I need an object-oriented programming language.
Many of the scripts here are from a long time ago, when I was younger (like elementary/middle school)
