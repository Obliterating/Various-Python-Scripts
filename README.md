# Various-Python-Scripts
I began learning to code when I was in elementary school, I think in the 2nd grade. I believe I learned javascript first, but later moved on to Python with codecademy. I've used Python whenever I need an object-oriented programming language.
Many of the scripts here are from a long time ago, when I was younger (like elementary/middle school)
Notable scripts include:
- nCr calculator which combined my love for programming with my love for math (permutations and combinations are useful not only in my normal math classes but also competitive math like Mathcounts or the AMC)
- Price_Elasticity_Of_Demand_Solver which demonstrates how I would, for learning purposes, program scripts to help me better understand and memorize equations for my classes during virtual school.
- My Prime Number Counter which I wrote to find lots of prime numbers... I wrote this after hearing about a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime, in the 7th grade. When I showed this to my teacher, I felt proud of my achievement.
- bcalculator helped me do math quickly for a game

Some of these scripts are unfinished, but I decided to upload them here anyways.
